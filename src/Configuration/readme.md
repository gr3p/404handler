# Configuration Settings Project
This project uses the Configuration Section Designer (CSD) found on CodePlex (http://csd.codeplex.com/).

It has been separated into it's own project so the core project can be compiled without having to install the CSD plugin in Visual Studio.

The core project references the `Bvn404HandlerConfiguration.csd.cs` file directly, which has been generated by the CSD plugin.

Unless you want to change the configuration section implementation, you will typically not need to change or compile this project.
